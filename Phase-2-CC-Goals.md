# Phase 2 Code Challenge: Things to Get Good At

- building components and linking them together (import/export)
- visualizing the React app as a tree and/or body
- defining props and passing them from parent to child
- passing callback functions as props to be used in child components
- adding event listeners (the big ones: onChange, onClick, onSubmit) to JSX elements
- calling passed-down functions in your event listeners
- using the useState hook to hold information globally in state and access and/or change it throughout the app
- using the useEffect hook to trigger some action on page load and/or when a watched variable changes
- fetching data from a simple backend (i.e. a db.json or other data-containing file)
