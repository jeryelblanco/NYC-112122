# Phase 3 Code Challenge Topics
## [see rubric here](https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/5257/assignments/220141?module_item_id=513110)
## Build classes using OO Ruby Syntax
You should be able to build ruby classes corresponding to your database tables

Key concept, fill in the blank: If each ruby class you create corresponds to a table in your database, each instance of the class corresponds to a [*what?*] in that table
## Object Relationship Methods
You should be able to use Active Record macros to set up the associations between database tables (e.g. has_one, has_many)

You should understand how each Active Record association sets up tables with primary and foreign keys under the hood

You should also understand how, under the hood, Active Record generates methods that allow your classes to access each other's information
## Custom Methods
You should be able to build custom class methods and instance methods inside your models

For example: If you have a class Album and a class Rating, and each album has many ratings, you should be able to write a method that sorts the list of albums from highest to lowest average rating. Key questions: Would this be a class or instance method? Would you want to define it in the Album class or the Rating class?
## Finally, rake console
You should be comfortable using the rake console to access your database information and test out your methods, both your custom methods and the ones automatically generated by Active Record
