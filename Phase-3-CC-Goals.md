# Phase 3 Code Challenge Topics
## [see rubric here](https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/5257/assignments/220141?module_item_id=513110)
## Build classes using OO Ruby Syntax
- You should be able to build ruby classes corresponding to your database tables

- Key concept, fill in the blank: If each ruby class you create corresponds to a table in your database, each instance of the class corresponds to a [*what?*] in that table
## Object Relationship Methods
- You should be able to use Active Record macros to set up the associations between database tables (e.g. has_one, has_many)

- You should understand how each Active Record association connects your tables with foreign keys under the hood

- You should also understand how, under the hood, Active Record generates methods that allow your classes to access each other's information
## Custom Methods
- You should be able to build custom class methods and instance methods inside your models

- For example: If you have a class Album and a class Rating, and each album has many ratings, you should be able to write a method that sorts the list of albums from highest to lowest average rating. Key questions: Would this be a class or instance method? Would you want to define it in the Album class or the Rating class?
## Finally, rake console
- You should be comfortable using the rake console to access your database information and test out your methods, both your custom methods and the ones automatically generated by Active Record
